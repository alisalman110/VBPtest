This guide is intended to provide best pracices for Veeam Backup & Replication. It is not meant as a full documentation or detailed explanation of the features. Please refer to the [Veeam Help Center](https://helpcenter.veeam.com) for this kind of documents.

The best practice guide is intended for professionals who search for a best practice answer to different topics. It gives the answer and an optional explanation on why this answer is the best practice to allow quick adoption of best practises.

Be aware that a best practice is not the only answer available. It will fit in the majority of cases but can also be totally wrong under different circumstances. Make sure you understand the implications of the advised best practices or ask someone who does.
