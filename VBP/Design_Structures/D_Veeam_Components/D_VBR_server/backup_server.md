# Veeam Backup Server

Introduction and see link at bottom of page

## Tape Server Placement

## Tape Server OS requirements


## Tape Server Sizing

<!-- Taken from current BP -->

In this section, we will describe how to configure and size the Veeam backup server.

Sizing with Veeam is cumulative in respect to configurations, if you want to create an all-in-one appliance (Appliance Model) add all the resource requirements together (CPU + Memory) to understand what in total you will need, combining roles such as the proxy and repository merits the same considerations

### Compute and memory requirements

The minimum configuration to start with is **4 Cores and 8 GB RAM**. 

Recommended Veeam backup server configuration is **1 CPU core (physical or virtual) and 5 GB RAM per 10 concurrently running jobs**. Concurrent jobs include any running backup or replication jobs as well as any job with a continuous schedule such as backup copy jobs and tape jobs.

For every additional concurrent task above 16, add 512MB RAM to the Backup Management Server.

### Installation folder

Default location is `C:\Program Files\Veeam\Backup and Replication`.

Plan for 40 GB. If installing in a virtual machine, thin disks may be used. By default the installer will choose the drive with most available free space for the built in backup repository.

### Log files

Plan for 3 GB log files generated per 100 protected instances, with a 24 hour RPO. For environments with more than 500 protected instances it is recommended to change the default location to a different fast access disk. Many concurrently running jobs may produce a lot of write streams to log files, than can slow down operations for the Veeam Backup Service and Backup Manager processes.

### Veeam Backup Catalog folder

It is recommended to reserve at least 10 GB space for this folder. If you plan to start a significant number of VMs or run VMs over a longer period  increase the space accordingly to fit the produced/estimated amount of changes generated by the running VMs (conservative average change rate can be defined as 100 GB per 1 TB VM per 24 hours - or 10%). Additional disk space is consumed when using Quick Migration. See more information [here](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/vsphere/instant_recovery_before_you_begin_vm.html).
